<strong> VEnc: A Video Security Application </strong>
A simple flask application to encrypt/decrypt video files
The main idea behind this study is to use a single private key to both encrypt
and decrypt the desired video. The length of the private key is not fixed here and it can
be a combination of different data types. By raising the complexity of encryption and
making it more resistant to certain sorts of assaults, a variable key length brings about
an increase in the level of security that can be achieved through cryptography. For the
purposes of encryption and decryption, the term "key length" refers to the number of
bits or characters that are contained within the cryptographic key. We have developed
a user-friendly Web App through which the sender can encrypt his/her sensitive video
securely and the receiver can use the private key to decrypt the same.
